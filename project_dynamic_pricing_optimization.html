            <h2>Motivation & Objective</h2>
            <p>In the Real Estate (RE) industry, pricing is generally done by experts, considering the asset's features,
                the current market conditions, and sometimes the financial and time constraints relative to the RE
                project. These constraints can be bank loan repayment debts, and/or deadlines to entirely sell a
                property (e.g. all units of a building). This project aims at getting rid of the biases introduced by
                realtors and at fully taking into account the financial and time constraints, as well as the current
                inventory in the pricing process. It
                also aims at making pricing dynamic: reeavaluating assets prices under current inventory and
                satisfaction of the
                financial constraints.
            </p>
            <p>The project's scope extends from sales and listings data scraping, to devising the pricing algorithm and
                testing it in a simulation environment.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple building blocks to this project:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Scraping</strong>: The data required by the ML and optimization algorithms can be
                    scraped on the main real estate market places. Information about both current listings and previous
                    sales can be found in a such way.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Value and Time-on-Market ML models</strong>: Using past sales data, it is easy to
                    build two ML models assigning to each asset a market value and a predicted absorption time: the time
                    an asset takes to sell once it is listed at a certain price. The Market Value model is Gradient
                    Boosted Trees that are fitted on previous sale prices. Making the assumption that this model gives a
                    true market value, it is possible to estimate from the model's error, an overpricing coefficient for
                    every past sale. This overpricing coefficient is used as a predictor to derive the absorption time
                    of RE assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing Algorithm</strong>: This algorithm adapts RE assets prices in time, in order
                    to satisfy financial and time constraints (revenues and # of sales targets in time). Monitoring
                    actual sale and revenue rates and comparing them to the expected ones, RE assets' prices can be
                    adapted to satisfy financial and time constraints. The starting price can be informed by the Market
                    Value model and the algorithm's parameters can be informed by the time-on-market model.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulation</strong>: It is possible to simulate demand (on the whole market, on the whole
                    inventory and on unique assets) using past sales data, by making a few assumptions. Using the
                    overpricing distribution of past sales it is possible to make the demand dependent on the assets'
                    prices.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Putting everything together, given information on a building and its units layout, it is possible to
                build an algorithm that prices monthly every building's unit. The simulation environment allows to
                compare a static pricing strategy to the Dynamic Pricing algorithm.</p>
            <p>More thorough explanation and visualizations can be found in the summary slides (cf. link at the top of
                the page).</p>
