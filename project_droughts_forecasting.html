            <h2>Motivation & Objective</h2>
            <p>Since 1980, the US experienced 26 major droughts, each event averaging a cost of $9.6 billion. It is
                also well known that droughts frequency and intensities will increase in the US and globally. It is thus
                interesting to build droughts prediction models that could be able to generalize well and to predict
                droughts with the greatest possible lead times.
            </p>

            <p>Using weather time series, previous drought scores and static soil data, I compare the performance of
                Linear Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees, Dense Neural Network, and LSTM to perform droughts
                forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset used for this project is composed of daily weather observations in the US, that come from
                the
                NASA POWER (Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) Project, of soil data that come from the
                Harmonized
                World Soil Database, and of drought score that come from the U.S. Drought Monitor. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weather data</strong>: The weather data contains daily observations of 18 weather variables
                (Temperature, Wind, Humidity, Precipitations, etc. information) in the US, at a county level (each of
                them
                represented by a FIPS code). It is already split in three sets: a train set, a validation and test set
                that
                all cover 3058 counties, respectively from 2000 to 2016, 2016 to 2018 and from 2018 to 2020. <br>

                <strong>Soil data</strong>: The soil data is static data that contains around 30 variables concerning
                the
                soil agricultural characteristics (distribution of slopes levels, aspects, land use, etc. in each
                county).
                This data is available for every county that either appears in the train, or in all timeseries.<br>

                <strong>Target variable</strong>: The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) is produced through a partnership
                between
                the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the United States
                Department
                of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It provides for each of the
                3058
                studied counties a continuous drought score ranging from 0 to 5, once per week and for each county, but
                is
                often presented in 5 classes (No Drought - Exceptional Drought). The particularity of this drought score
                is
                that it combines multiple drought indices or indicators to create a unique metric, that results in being
                a
                more objective drought value. Is is a combination of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), of the
                CPC
                Soil Moisture Model,and of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). As the score is provided on a
                weekly
                basis, we interpolate it for convenience in the model development.
            </p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <h4>Regression task</h4>
            <p>After exploring, analyzing and cleaning the data, I compare multiple models. The target variable is a
                continuous score that is regressed. However, to stick to USDM's 6 scores categories, I bin the predicted
                drought scores in the 6 drought severity categories and compute the forecasting average Macro F1 score.
                With the forecasting MSE, these are the two main performance metrics that are monitored.</p>

            <h4>Modeling</h4>
            <p>I compared multiple forecasting methods: <br>
                <strong>Naive models</strong>: Two Naive models that represent the performance baseline: an
                identity-model that uses current drought scores as predictions, and a model that interpolates droughts
                based on the two last droughts scores.<br>
                <strong>ML models</strong>: Classic ML techniques (Ridge regression, Gradient
                Boosted Trees). Weather observations are flattened or averaged to take into account long-term
                dependencies between weather and droughts. Different combinations of regularization, time window (how
                far we look in the past), and features are tested to best solve the problem. <br>
                <strong>LSTM</strong>: Using the best set of features found while devising ML models.
